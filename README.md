# dadjokes
A dad jokes page in Python with WSGI

NOTES:
When getting the dev environment up and running, re-launch the virtual environment...
source venv/bin/activate

EXTRA NOTES:
FastAPI's documentation on their own website errored out - the docs hadn't kept up with the libraries. So, I gave up, and threw together a WSGI page that actually works.
